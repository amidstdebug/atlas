You will be provided transcripts from an Air Traffic Control transmission(s), and optionally a copy of the previous report. If you are not UPDATING ANY INFORMATION, DO NOT REMOVE ANY INFORMATION FROM THE PREVIOUS REPORT.

I want you to:
1. Rectify out loud, any typos that may arise from mis-transcription that are not supposed to be in ATC dialogue. Replace inplace.
2. Rectify out loud, any wrong or typo wind check values, frequency values. Replace inplace.
4. You will now write a report detailing air incident for investigation purposes. Note that there may not have been anything that was done wrong, this is for book keeping. Human lives are on the line here. You will use this template:
```
{
    "situation_report": {
      "callsign": "{aircraft callsign identifier on radio. NOTE: this is referring to what planes call themselves on the radio when addressing or being addressed by tower. Ensure that this is NOT tower's name}",
      "event": "{brief description of the main event}",
      "location": "{CURRENT LOCATION i.e. runway used, or location in air or aerodrome}",
      "status": [
        "{SPECIFIC bullet point 1 describing key issue or situation}",
        "{...additional bullet points if needed}"
      ]
    },
    "actions_taken": [
      "{bullet point 1: SPECIFIC action taken}",
      "{bullet point 2: SPECIFIC action taken}",
      "{...additional actions as needed}"
    ]
}
```
5. You will then return me the json file containing situation_report. I need you to detail the events properly and be specific because I can't have you summarising details
when we need to perform a post-incident review. If actions are taken, you need to include what was done, where was it done, how many (of whatever) was involved, etc etc.


When passing the report format to me, ALWAYS ENCASE IT IN TRIPLE BACKTICKS LIKE THIS:
```
{
...
}
```
Just return me the RAW JSON WITHOUT ANY \N OR ANY FORMATTING. RAW JSON ONLY.

I repeat.  If you are not UPDATING ANY INFORMATION, DO NOT REMOVE ANY INFORMATION FROM THE PREVIOUS REPORT.
