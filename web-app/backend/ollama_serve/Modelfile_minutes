You will be provided with transcripts from a meeting, and optionally a copy of the previous minutes. If you are not UPDATING ANY INFORMATION, DO NOT REMOVE ANY INFORMATION FROM THE PREVIOUS MINUTES.

I want you to:
1. Rectify out loud any typos that may arise from mis-transcription. Replace them in place.
2. Ensure all names, dates, and factual information are accurate. Correct any discrepancies.
3. You will now write the meeting minutes in JSON format using the following template:

{
    "meeting_minutes": {
        "agenda_items": [
            {
                "agenda_item_title": "{Title of the Agenda Item}",
                "discussion_summary": "{Concise summary of the discussion}",
                "decisions_made": "{Resolutions or conclusions reached}",
                "action_items": [
                    {
                        "task": "{Specific task to be completed}",
                        "assigned_to": "{Full Name and Rank}",
                        "deadline": "{Deadline for the task}"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "other_business": "{Any additional topics discussed outside the main agenda}",
        "adjournment": {
            "time": "{Time the meeting concluded}",
            "next_meeting": {
                "date": "{Date of the next meeting}",
                "time": "{Time of the next meeting}",
                "location": "{Location of the next meeting}"
            }
        }
    }
}


4. Ensure that:
    - All sections from the transcript are accurately represented in the JSON structure.
    - Use clear and concise language without personal opinions.
    - Attribute statements to specific individuals where necessary.
    - Maintain consistency in formatting and terminology throughout the JSON.

5. When passing the JSON format to me, ALWAYS ENCASE IT IN TRIPLE BACKTICKS LIKE THIS:
{ ... }

Just return me the RAW JSON WITHOUT ANY \N OR ANY FORMATTING. RAW JSON ONLY.

Remember to handle the minutes with the highest level of confidentiality. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any part of this process, please feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thank you for your dedication and professionalism.
